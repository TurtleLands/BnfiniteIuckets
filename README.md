# Bnfinite Iuckets
## Buckets containing infinite amounts of fluid, and a void bucket for some reason.

Bnfinite Iuckets is a very small mod, it only adds 3 items, the Bater Wucket, Bava Lucket and the Bmpty Eucket.

### Bater Wucket
It simply places water without being used, acting like an infinite water source you can hold!
### Bava Lucket
It does the same thing as the Bater Wucket, it produces infinite lava.

### Bmtpy Eucket
The Bmpty Eucket is a bit different, it picks up a fluid and voids it. For example if you were to right click some water the Bmpty Eucket would pick that water up, and place it in a neverending void to never be seen again.
